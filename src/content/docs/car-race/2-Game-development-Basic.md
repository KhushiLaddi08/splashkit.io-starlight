## Introduction

Welcome to the Game Development Basics tutorial with SplashKit. In this tutorial, we'll cover essential concepts and techniques, including the game loop structure, sprites, animation, collision detection, and sound effects.

## Game Loop Structure

The game loop is the core structure that controls the flow of a game. It typically consists of three main stages:

1. **Input Processing**: 
   - Check for player input such as keyboard presses, mouse clicks, or controller inputs.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void process_input() {
         if (key_down(LEFT_KEY)) {
             // Handle left arrow key press
         }
         // Other input handling...
     }
     ```

2. **Update**:
   - Execute game logic, update object positions, handle collisions, and apply game rules.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void update_game() {
         // Update player position
         player.update();
         // Handle collisions
         check_collisions();
         // Other updates...
     }
     ```

3. **Rendering**:
   - Draw game graphics, including background images, characters, and other elements.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void render_game() {
         // Draw background
         draw_background();
         // Draw game objects
         draw_player();
         // Other rendering...
     }
     ```

## Sprites, Animation, and Bitmap Manipulation

Sprites are movable and animated images used to represent game objects. SplashKit provides robust support for creating and manipulating sprites:

1. **Creating Sprites**:
   - Load bitmap images or draw shapes directly to create sprites.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     bitmap player_bitmap = load_bitmap("player.png");
     sprite player_sprite = create_sprite(player_bitmap);
     ```

2. **Animation**:
   - Animate sprites by changing their position, rotation, and image frame over time.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void animate_player() {
         // Animate player sprite
         animate_sprite(player_sprite, "run");
     }
     ```

3. **Bitmap Manipulation**:
   - Modify bitmap properties such as size, color, and transparency.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void manipulate_bitmap() {
         // Change bitmap properties
         set_bitmap_transparency(player_bitmap, 50);
         // Other bitmap manipulation...
     }
     ```

## Collision Detection

Collision detection is crucial for handling interactions between game objects:

1. **Basic Collision Detection**:
   - Detect collisions between sprites based on their bounding boxes or custom shapes.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     bool check_collision(sprite obj1, sprite obj2) {
         return sprite_collision(obj1, obj2);
     }
     ```

2. **Advanced Collision Detection**:
   - Implement pixel-perfect collision detection or custom collision response algorithms for complex scenarios.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     bool check_pixel_perfect_collision(sprite obj1, sprite obj2) {
         return pixel_perfect_collision(obj1, obj2);
     }
     ```

## Sound Effects

Sound effects enhance the gaming experience by providing auditory feedback to players:

1. **Loading Sound Effects**:
   - Load sound effects in various formats such as WAV, MP3, or OGG.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     sound_effect explosion_sound = load_sound_effect("explosion.wav");
     ```

2. **Playing Sound Effects**:
   - Play sound effects at specific times or in response to game events.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void play_explosion_sound() {
         play_sound_effect(explosion_sound);
     }
     ```
