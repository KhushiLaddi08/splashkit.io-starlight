## Introduction

Welcome to the Game Management tutorial with SplashKit. In this tutorial, we'll cover essential concepts and techniques for managing game initialization, user input, obstacle spawning, score tracking, and game over conditions.

## Game Initialization

Initializing the game environment involves setting up necessary resources, such as images, sounds, and initial game state:

1. **Resource Loading**:
   - Load images, sounds, and other resources required for the game.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void load_resources() {
         load_resource_bundle("game_bundle", "game_bundle.txt");
     }
     ```

2. **Game State Setup**:
   - Create and initialize game data structures, such as player's car, obstacle cars, and score.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     game_data new_game() {
         game_data game;
         game.car = new_car(RED, 0, screen_width() / 2, screen_height() - 200);
         // Initialize other game components...
         return game;
     }
     ```

## User Input Handling

Managing user input allows players to control game elements, such as car movement:

1. **Handling Car Movement**:
   - Respond to user input for controlling the player's car, such as left and right arrow keys.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void handle_input(game_data &game) {
         if (key_down(LEFT_KEY)) {
             // Move the player's car left
         } else if (key_down(RIGHT_KEY)) {
             // Move the player's car right
         }
     }
     ```

## Obstacle Spawning and Updating

Spawn and update obstacle cars to create challenging gameplay:

1. **Random Car Spawning**:
   - Randomly spawn obstacle cars at predefined intervals or positions.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void random_cars(game_data &game) {
         // Generate random obstacle car properties and spawn them
     }
     ```

2. **Updating Obstacle Cars**:
   - Update positions and states of obstacle cars based on game logic.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void update_game(game_data &game) {
         // Update player's car, obstacle cars, and other game components
     }
     ```

## Score Tracking and Game Over Conditions

Track player's score and determine game over conditions for a satisfying gameplay experience:

1. **Score Tracking**:
   - Increment score based on game progress or achievements.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void update_game(game_data &game) {
         // Update player's score based on game progress
     }
     ```

2. **Game Over Conditions**:
   - Check for conditions that lead to game over, such as collision with obstacle cars or reaching a certain score threshold.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```cpp
     void update_game(game_data &game) {
         if (check_collision(player_car, obstacle_car) || game.score >= MAX_SCORE) {
             game.game_over = true;
         }
     }
     ```
