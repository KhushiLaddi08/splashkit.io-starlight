## Introduction

Welcome to the Car Handling tutorial with SplashKit. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to handle cars in your game using the features provided by the SplashKit library. We'll cover the creation of different car models, drawing and updating car positions, and switching car skins during gameplay.

## Car Models Creation

1. **Car Bitmap Loading**:
   - Load bitmap images for different car models:
     ```cpp
     bitmap red_car_bitmap = load_bitmap("red_car.png");
     bitmap yellow_car_bitmap = load_bitmap("yellow_car.png");
     ```

2. **Car Model Enumeration**:
   - Define an enumeration for different car models:
     ```cpp
     enum car_model {
         RED,
         YELLOW,
         // Add more car models as needed...
     };
     ```

## Drawing and Updating Car Position

1. **Car Structure Definition**:
   - Define a structure to store car data:
     ```cpp
     struct car_data {
         sprite car_sprite;
         car_model model;
         double speed;
     };
     ```

2. **Car Creation**:
   - Create a new car with specified model, speed, and position:
     ```cpp
     car_data red_car = new_car(RED, 5.0, 100.0, 200.0);
     ```

3. **Drawing Car**:
   - Draw the car sprite on the screen:
     ```cpp
     draw_car(red_car);
     ```

4. **Updating Car Position**:
   - Update the car's position based on its speed:
     ```cpp
     update_car(red_car);
     ```

## Switching Car Skin During Gameplay

1. **Switching Car Skin Function**:
   - Implement a function to switch the car's skin during gameplay:
     ```cpp
     void switch_car_skin(car_data &car) {
         // Switch car skin logic here...
     }
     ```

2. **Handling User Input**:
   - Handle user input to switch the car's skin:
     ```cpp
     if (key_typed(R_KEY)) {
         switch_car_skin(red_car);
     }
     ```
