## Introduction

Welcome to the Modular Design tutorial with C++. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to design modular game systems using functions to encapsulate different aspects of gameplay and structures to organize related data.

## Functions for Gameplay Aspects

1. **Car Handling Functions**:
   - Create functions to handle different aspects of car behavior, such as movement and skin switching.
     ```cpp
     void move_car(double dx, double dy);
     void switch_car_skin(car_data &car);
     ```

2. **Game Management Functions**:
   - Implement functions to manage game states, handle input, and update game logic.
     ```cpp
     void handle_input(game_data &game);
     void update_game(game_data &game);
     ```

## Structures for Data Organization

1. **Game State Structure**:
   - Define a structure to organize game-related data, such as player information and obstacle cars.
     ```cpp
     struct game_data {
         player_data player;
         vector<car_data> cars;
         int score;
         bool game_over;
     };
     ```

2. **Car Data Structure**:
   - Create a structure to store data related to cars, including position, speed, and model.
     ```cpp
     struct car_data {
         double x, y;
         double speed;
         car_model model;
     };
     ```

## Modular Design Benefits

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Functions encapsulate specific gameplay aspects, making code more organized and easier to maintain.
   - Structures encapsulate related data, improving code readability and organization.

2. **Reusability**:
   - Modular design allows for the reuse of functions and structures across different parts of the game.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Modular code can be easily scaled and extended as the game evolves, without introducing complex dependencies.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to design modular game systems using functions to encapsulate gameplay aspects and structures to organize related data in C++. By adopting modular design principles, you can create more organized, reusable, and scalable game codebases.
