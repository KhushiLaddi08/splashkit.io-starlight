## Introduction

Welcome to the Event-Driven Logic tutorial in game development with C++. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement game logic driven by user input events and time-based triggers.

## User Input Events

1. **Handling Key Press Events**:
   - Implement functions to handle key press events for player interaction.
     ```cpp
     void handle_key_press(int key);
     ```

2. **Mouse Click Events**:
   - Process mouse click events to enable player interaction with game elements.
     ```cpp
     void handle_mouse_click(int x, int y);
     ```

## Time-Based Triggers

1. **Spawning Obstacle Cars**:
   - Use time-based triggers to spawn obstacle cars at regular intervals.
     ```cpp
     void spawn_obstacle_cars();
     ```

2. **Updating Game State**:
   - Update game state based on time intervals to keep the game running smoothly.
     ```cpp
     void update_game_state();
     ```

## Event-Driven Logic Benefits

1. **Responsive Gameplay**:
   - Event-driven logic enables responsive gameplay by immediately responding to user input events.

2. **Dynamic Challenges**:
   - Time-based triggers create dynamic challenges by introducing new obstacles or events at specific intervals.

3. **Simplified Code Structure**:
   - Implementing event-driven logic helps to maintain a clean and organized code structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to implement event-driven logic in game development using C++. By leveraging user input events and time-based triggers, you can create engaging and interactive gameplay experiences.
