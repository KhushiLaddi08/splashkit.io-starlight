## Introduction

Welcome to the Graphics and Audio tutorial with SplashKit. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to render road markings, cars, and the game background, as well as play sound effects for car movement and collisions using the SplashKit library.

## Rendering Road Markings and Background

1. **Road Markings Bitmap Loading**:
   - Load bitmap image for road markings:
     ```cpp
     bitmap road_markings_bitmap = load_bitmap("road_markings.png");
     ```

2. **Drawing Road Markings**:
   - Draw road markings on the screen:
     ```cpp
     draw_bitmap(road_markings_bitmap, 0, 0);
     ```

3. **Background Bitmap Loading**:
   - Load bitmap image for the game background:
     ```cpp
     bitmap background_bitmap = load_bitmap("background.png");
     ```

4. **Drawing Background**:
   - Draw the game background on the screen:
     ```cpp
     draw_bitmap(background_bitmap, 0, 0);
     ```

## Rendering Cars

1. **Car Bitmap Loading**:
   - Load bitmap images for different car models:
     ```cpp
     bitmap red_car_bitmap = load_bitmap("red_car.png");
     bitmap yellow_car_bitmap = load_bitmap("yellow_car.png");
     ```

2. **Drawing Cars**:
   - Draw car sprites on the screen:
     ```cpp
     draw_car(red_car);
     draw_car(yellow_car);
     ```

## Playing Sound Effects

1. **Sound Effect Loading**:
   - Load sound effects for car movement and collisions:
     ```cpp
     sound_effect car_movement_sound = load_sound_effect("car_movement.wav");
     sound_effect collision_sound = load_sound_effect("collision.wav");
     ```

2. **Playing Sound Effects**:
   - Play sound effects for car movement and collisions:
     ```cpp
     play_sound_effect(car_movement_sound);
     play_sound_effect(collision_sound);
     ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to render road markings, cars, and the game background, as well as play sound effects for car movement and collisions using the SplashKit library. Experiment with different graphics and audio effects to enhance your game's visual and auditory experience.
