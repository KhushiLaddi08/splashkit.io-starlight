## Introduction

Welcome to the SplashKit Library Features tutorial. In this tutorial, we'll dive into the features offered by the SplashKit library, a powerful toolkit for game development in C++. We'll cover sprite creation, drawing, animation, bitmap loading, manipulation, sound effect loading, and playback.

## Sprite Creation, Drawing, and Animation

1. **Sprite Creation**:
   - Sprites are movable and animated images used to represent game objects.
   - Create a sprite from a bitmap:
     ```cpp
     bitmap player_bitmap = load_bitmap("player.png");
     sprite player_sprite = create_sprite(player_bitmap);
     ```

2. **Drawing Sprites**:
   - Draw a sprite on the screen:
     ```cpp
     draw_sprite(player_sprite);
     ```

3. **Animation**:
   - Animate a sprite by changing its position, rotation, and image frame over time:
     ```cpp
     void animate_player() {
         animate_sprite(player_sprite, "run");
     }
     ```

## Bitmap Loading and Manipulation

1. **Bitmap Loading**:
   - Load bitmap images from files:
     ```cpp
     bitmap background_bitmap = load_bitmap("background.png");
     ```

2. **Bitmap Manipulation**:
   - Modify bitmap properties such as size, color, and transparency:
     ```cpp
     set_bitmap_transparency(player_bitmap, 50);
     ```

## Sound Effect Loading and Playback

1. **Sound Effect Loading**:
   - Load sound effects in various formats such as WAV, MP3, or OGG:
     ```cpp
     sound_effect explosion_sound = load_sound_effect("explosion.wav");
     ```

2. **Sound Effect Playback**:
   - Play sound effects at specific times or in response to game events:
     ```cpp
     void play_explosion_sound() {
         play_sound_effect(explosion_sound);
     }
     ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've explored the key features of the SplashKit library for game development. With SplashKit, you can create dynamic and engaging games with ease. Experiment with sprite creation, bitmap loading, sound effect playback, and more to bring your game ideas to life!
