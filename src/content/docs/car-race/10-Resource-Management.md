## Introduction

Welcome to the Resource Management tutorial in game development with SplashKit. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to efficiently manage resources like bitmaps, sound effects, and collision masks to enhance the performance and accuracy of your games.

## Bitmap Management

1. **Loading Bitmaps**:
   - Use SplashKit functions to load bitmap images from files or create bitmaps from scratch.
     ```cpp
     bitmap my_bitmap = load_bitmap("image.png");
     ```

2. **Manipulating Bitmaps**:
   - Modify bitmap properties such as size, transparency, and rotation to create dynamic visuals.
     ```cpp
     set_bitmap_transparency(my_bitmap, 50);
     ```

## Sound Effect Management

1. **Loading Sound Effects**:
   - Load sound effects in various formats such as WAV, MP3, or OGG using SplashKit functions.
     ```cpp
     sound_effect my_sound = load_sound_effect("sound.wav");
     ```

2. **Playing Sound Effects**:
   - Play loaded sound effects at specific times or in response to game events.
     ```cpp
     play_sound_effect(my_sound);
     ```

## Collision Mask Setup

1. **Creating Collision Masks**:
   - Set up collision masks for game objects to accurately detect collisions between them.
     ```cpp
     setup_collision_mask(my_bitmap);
     ```

2. **Detecting Collisions**:
   - Use collision detection functions provided by SplashKit to detect collisions between game objects with collision masks.
     ```cpp
     bool is_collision = sprite_collision(obj1, obj2);
     ```

## Benefits of Efficient Resource Management

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Efficient resource management helps optimize game performance by reducing memory usage and improving rendering speed.

2. **Accurate Collision Detection**:
   - Properly configured collision masks ensure accurate collision detection, enhancing the realism and fairness of the gameplay.

3. **Enhanced Player Experience**:
   - By managing resources effectively, you can create immersive gaming experiences with high-quality visuals and sound effects.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to efficiently manage resources such as bitmaps, sound effects, and collision masks in game development using SplashKit. Implement these techniques in your projects to create engaging and polished games.
